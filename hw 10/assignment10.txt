Assignment 10


We are nearly done with the class. The develiverables are 
1. Your embodied web-based chatbot (in your github repository)
2. Project (demo and github directory with materials)

Here are the details
1. Web-based chatbot

We will put all the chatbots online for outsiders to see (and possibly score). Please update your best bot with the following:
- Make your bot introduce itself. A user must be able to figure out what to say without looking at your source code. Do some user testing to see that users not familiar with your bot can actually figure out how to talk to it. You can use Recall and Precision measures to evaluate the success of your bot's performance.
- Give your bot a name in the README.md file.
- Optional: Render your name somewhere in the Window
- Upload all source files/images to github and send me a link.

2. Project:
- Monday presentations for Milestone 2 are for all the teams except for Declutter who presented at the last class. As mentioned before, the focus should be 
  - user testing and 
  - hopefully a demo of completed web-based prototype. 

  The rest of the week can be spent for Arduino integration, if needed.
