Earlier we have learned about expressing emotions and personality via a conversational agent. 
Another dimension that humans tend to perceive and express is cultural background.

Have a short write up answering the following questions:

1. What is "culture"?
Culture can be defined in numerous ways. But in my opinion, it contains all the background of who the person is including belief, law, custom and any other capabilities or habits acquired a person to become a member of society. Culture is the one it shapes the person. 

2. Why is it useful to express culture?
I think expressing culture is very useful for user to understand what kind of personality the other has. So, in chatbot, it will help the user to define what kind of characters it has because a lot of users treat the chatbot as a person; nowadays, people call social bot. 

3. How can an agent express culture?
In verbal expression, the volume, pitch and rate could be a strong expression. For example, even with the same voice as Alex, with different pitch, it is totally different character. But also nonverbal expression could be a strong way to express culture for virtual agents. Gestures could be an example. We communicate emotion through body posture and gesture and also we infer other’s emotional state based on perceived posture or gesture. I think this idea could be applied to robot especially one has physical form, not just the internet based chatbot. 

4. Many of you have characters that are not human-like (a cat, a burger, etc.) Would you consider them expressing some culture? (If yes, why and how would you do that. If no, then why not?)
No for me. First of all,  the character I chose is my favorite. So I would say it is related to express my own personality. As for me, any cute and tiny creature that deliver happy vibe, then that is the one I’m in. And this Snoopy character is the one for me for a long time. So, there was no hesitation to choose Snoopy for my character for my chatbot.
