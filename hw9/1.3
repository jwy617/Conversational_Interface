Earlier we have learned about expressing emotions and personality via a conversational agent. 
Another dimension that humans tend to perceive and express is cultural background. 

Read this paper from our Stanford neighbors Heidy Maldonado and Barabar Hayes-Roth:

Have a short write up answering the following questions:

1. What is "culture"?
Culture is defined with careful reconsideration of each of the ten key characteristics - *Identity, Backstory, Appearance, Content of speech, Manner of speaking, Manner of gesturing, Emotional dynamics, Social interaction patterns, Role, and Role dynamics.*

In my opinion, culture contains all the background of who the person is including belief, law, custom and any other capabilities or habits acquired a person to become a member of society.


2. Why is it useful to express culture?
Expressing culture is useful for user to understand what kind of personality the other has. Therefore, in robot design, it will help the user to define what kind of characters it has because a lot of users treat the chatbot as a person; nowadays, people call social bot. But also it will help maker to build the bot based on the culture that they are focusing on.


3. How can an agent express culture?
According to the paper, cultural nuances can be expressed through the key ten qualities - *Identity, Backstory, Appearance, Content of speech, Manner of speaking, Manner of gesturing, Emotional dynamics, Social interaction patterns, Role, and Role dynamics.

They said those aspects are not only to aid the learners in their foreign language acquisition and development, but also complement with a deeper understanding of the culture they are studying.


4. Many of you have characters that are not human-like (a cat, a burger, etc.) Would you consider them expressing some culture? (If yes, why and how would you do that. If no, then why not?)
No for me. First of all,  the character I chose is my favorite. So I would say it is related to express my own personality. As for me, any cute and tiny creature that deliver happy vibe, then that is the one Iâ€™m in. And this Snoopy character is the one for me for a long time. So, there was no hesitation to choose Snoopy for my character for my chatbot. 

With the character, the chatbot has the function of ordering food. I tried to express a happy jumping moment when the Snoopy response with placing Woodstock right aside with the character.
