2. (20%) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Xr3AsBEK4      Write a couple of paragraphs describing your opinion about the talk.

When I first saw the topic of the video, which is “connected, but alone?,” I intuitively get the idea that it will be a story about technology and human. And eventually, it was about connection between human and the devices we always use or always set along with us. 

At some point, I agree with her idea that we are deeply committed  ourselves using phone or any technology that around us. Sometimes, for some people, this technology changes what they do, but for worse case, it even changes who they are.

I think, however, this is not the right way to utilize technology. As I mentioned ‘utilize technology,’ this is a thing that we are using it not dominated by them. Social robots will help us to communicate with people and communicate with ourselves. Those robots are not the only one we will talk. Therefore, when we find the way of using technology and build a self-awareness relationship devices, we will find a better way to communicate each other and also ourselves.


3. (20%) Read the Linguistic Forms section of the Wikipedia article on Ambiguity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity#Linguistic_forms      Write about the possible linguistic ambiguities in your two chatbots.

I read the article and tried to thick about the examples for my own chatbot that I worked for this assignment, but I couldn’t think any good examples..
I will post later if I got better examples..
