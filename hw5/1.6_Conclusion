TEST 1
  True Positive (TP) = 10
  False Positive (FP) = 3
  False Negative (FN) = 3
  True Negative (TN) = 6

  Precision = 0.77
  Recall = 0.77

TEST 2
  True Positive (TP) = 12
  False Positive (FP) = 1
  False Negative (FN) = 3
  True Negative (TN) = 6

  Precision = 0.92
  Recall = 0.8

TEST 3
  True Positive (TP) = 16
  False Positive (FP) = 2
  False Negative (FN) = 3
  True Negative (TN) = 6

  Precision = 0.89
  Recall = 0.84


My final chatbot will be the third one. I think the ideal model should be balanced from each recall and precision, not leaning to one side of aspects. And it test shows a balanced chart, but also toward to the left top of the chart which is a perfect measure area. According to the chart, I would rather pick third result as a final chatbot.
